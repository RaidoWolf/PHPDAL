\subsection*{\hyperlink{namespace_p_h_p_d_a_l}{P\+H\+P\+D\+A\+L} -\/ P\+H\+P \hyperlink{class_database}{Database} Abstraction Library }

\hyperlink{namespace_p_h_p_d_a_l}{P\+H\+P\+D\+A\+L} is a P\+H\+P \hyperlink{class_database}{Database} Abstraction Library designed to provide a very high level interface to databases using purely object oriented code. The main goals of this library over similar libraries are the following\+:

Simplicity -\/ A database abstraction library should be easier to use than native database libraries or S\+Q\+L queries.

Speed -\/ Runtime-\/translation of S\+Q\+L queries using expensive regex operations is a bad practice. This library handles data using pre-\/written templates, basic string concatenation, otherwise you will have to pre-\/write a query for each language you need. This means better performance.

Maintainability -\/ This library is meant to be modular, easily configurable, and easy to develop. There is are focuses on limiting redundant code and enforcing a clearly defined standard. Practices used to ensure these focuses are met include using object oriented code, strict M\+V\+C separation, use of interfaces, and use of model or prototype classes and extending them for specific cases.
